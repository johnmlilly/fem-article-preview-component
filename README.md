## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to approach projects with a mobile-first mindset. I also learned that often when applying styling to an element I was inserting it onto the child element rather than the parent. I often added code and nothing changed, but when I fixed my mistake I realized what I had done wrong. 

I also  learned to apply patience to this project and not rush things. I would often find myself frustrated or annoyed I couldn't align two divs side-by-side easily, but I remembered to take my time, research different solutions, and reach out for help when I needed it. I utilized the slack channel for Frontend Mentor, too.
